/* Hello, my name is Summer.  
First off I would like to apologise to the person who's reading my codes. 
I am not a CS major but a law graduate.
The CV screening system must have mistaken my entry level Python programming for a CS major. 
Nevertheless, thank you for having me. 
I do not have any in real experience in coding but I am a tech enthusiast who is passionate about integrating technology and business. 
That's the reason I applied for this role.
Should the team allow a non-coding team member to join, I would love to proceed with my application. 
If not, kindly take this as my early withdrawal notice. 

Thank you, 
Summer */
